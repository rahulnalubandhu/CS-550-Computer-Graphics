Introduction
This project requires you to draw something fun in 3D.

It must be your own creation. You can use pre-canned 3D objects, such as the ones that GLUT provides or OBJ files, but in addition to your own, not instead of. You must create your own geometry.

You can explicitly list your own 3D coordinates, or you can use equations and define the 3D shapes procedurally.

You must have at least 100 x-y-z coordinates. These can be divided up among multiple of your objects.

The scene must have 3D thickness, nothing that is completely planar.

You must use at least 5 different colors.

The 3D rotation and scaling from the sample program must still be working.

Getting Started
Go to the Class Resources Page and scroll down to Downloadable Files. Then download one of the SampleWindows.zip, SampleLinux.tar, or SampleMac.tar files (by right-clicking on them). This will produce a folder full of all the other files you need. You do not need to go hunt the internet for any other files. Use the ones that have been given to you.

Start by getting the sample program to work. If you are on Windows, double-click on the .sln file. If you are on Linux or Max, type make

Then start modifying the function InitLists( ) to draw something of your own design.

No, using a GLUT object or an OBJ file will not count.
